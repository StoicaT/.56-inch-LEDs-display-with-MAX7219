# .56-inch-LEDs-display-with-MAX7219
Building and testing  a module with 8 digits LEDs drived by MAX7219. 

This project aims to build and test an 8-digit LED module, 0.56 inches, drived by MAX2719. There are 2 variants, THT and SMD. 
PCBs are designed with KiCad program and are given together with Wiring Diagram and assembly details.
There is also a test program, which will be uploaded on an Arduino board and will allow a detailed visual check of the module.
